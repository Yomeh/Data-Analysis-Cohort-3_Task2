# Task Two
This is the 2nd task assigned from the data analysis training with Promise Chinoso

# Introduction
As the training continues, we were then introduced into some complex aspect of MS Excel tool such as Cell referencing and basic formulas functions; 
SUM
AVERAGE
COUNT
MIN
MAX, etc. We were then given another task on data manipulation/anlysis with a dataset containing 701 roles and 12 columns of information.

# Activity
1. Calculate the total revenue and profit generated.
2. Calculate the average revenue and units sold for every order.
3. Calculate the total discount given in $.
4. Calculate the total number of sales recorded
5. What is the highest profit generated
6. Create a new column Sales Range and assign high sales to sale value above average and low sales to sale value below average.

# Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Manipulation
2. Use of the Sum function
3. Use of the Average function
4. Use of the Max function
5. Use of the COUNT function
6. Use of the IF function

# Total Revenue and Profit Generated
The formula for revenue is given by the ((number of units sold * sales price) - discount) which is given by sales in this table. Hence, to get the total revenue I used the sum function to add up all the values in the sales column. It is given by the following syntax: =SUM(J2:J701)

The Total Profit is generated by adding up all the values in the profit column using the sum function in the following syntax: =SUM(K2:K701)

# Average Revenue and Units Sold
To get the average revenue, I took the average of the sales range using the average function in the following syntax: =AVERAGE(J2:J701)

To get the average unit sold for every order, I took the average of the units sold range using the average function in the following syntax: AVERAGE(E2:E701)

# Total Discount in $
For this problem, I also utilized the sum function by adding up all of the values in the discount range using the sum syntax: =SUM(I2:I701)

# Total Number of Sales Recorded
To get the total number of sales recorded, I used the count function on the sales column by using the Count syntax: =COUNT(J2:J701)

# Highest Profit Generated
To get the highest profit generated, I used the MAX function in the following syntax: =MAX(K2:K701)

# Sales Range
To create the sales range column, I inserted another column after the last column in the table. Then I used the IF function to specify the conditions to be met from the sales column range(the sales value should be greater than the average sales value) so as to input the specified value that I want into the sales range column. The syntax was given as follows: =IF(J2:J701>average sales,"High Sales","Low Sales")

Where high sales is the value if the condition is true and low sales is the value if the condition is false

# Conclusion
Data analysis has always been about critical thinking, and working on this task really gave an insight into what to expect later on. The use of excel formulas and functions are key fundamentals in exploring the world of data.
